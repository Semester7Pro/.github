# 🐦‍🔥INCEPTION.JS

INCEPTION.JS is the official project organization for our Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project.

This organization is used to:
- Maintain all SIH-related repositories in one place
- Collaborate as a team using version control
- Track development, experiments, and documentation
- Present our work in a structured and transparent manner

Each repository under this organization represents a specific component of the SIH solution, including core implementation, supporting tools, and experimental work.
